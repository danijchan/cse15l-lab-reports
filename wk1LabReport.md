## Part 2: Remotely Connecting

Using your course-specific account for CSE15L, you can log in remotely. 
If you do not know your account, visit: 

[Click on Me!](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

Else, open VS Code, and open a terminal. You can open a terminal by typing Ctrl or Command + `, or use the Terminal â†’ New Terminal menu option.

In the terminal you created, type, but replace the zz with your own account's letters:

`ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

Now, you are asked to input your password, so do so accordingly. The terminal should say something like this:
