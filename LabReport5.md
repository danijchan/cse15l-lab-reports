# My Favorite Lab
## The experience

My favorite lab was the `grade.sh` project. I liked it because my TA basically forced us to work in larger groups as there were quite a few people missing that day.
I got closer to more of my groupmates and it was a good time all around. My groupmates were also really helpful in getting me through the lab activity.

## The Actual Lab

This lab was also my favorite because it was challenging. I didn't understand a lot of things during the lectures, even after reviewing the annotated notes.

## Completing The Task

Below is a screenshot of what the completed `grade.sh` looks like.

After reviewing with another group, we learned that when running the JUnit tests, that the `.` means that a test was started and `E` is when a test has failed.
We originally thought that a `.` was a test passed and `E` was a test failed. Both us, the students, and the TA, didn't know this until we finished the lab activity.

In the screenshot above, the grade should've been `1 / 1` but displayed `1 / 2` because of our mistake stated above.

Above is the second test case. Its says that it is expected to get full or near-full credit, which is what the results were.

## Other Things Learned

I also learned that coding in bash is extemely annoying. There were so many errors because of a couple missing spaces. We also learned that bash is `Enter` sensitive too.
Which means that if we were ever graded on style in bash, we would get poor scores. Honestly, figuring out these errors took most of our time, but it's good to know for
the future.
